    <h1>What is the BBC Archive Search portal?</h1>
    <p>
        The BBC Archive portal was previously know as the Rewind Portal and was born out of the BBC Rewind Project in BBC Northern Ireland. The portal has been moved into BBC Platform for continued development and support on its journey to become the primary first port of access to archive material. With the move into Platform the name has been changed to the Archive Search Portal to fit into the wider archive ecosystem branding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The portal is designed to enable storytellers and programme makers to discover “golden nuggets” of archive to lend the light of nostalgia and the depth of historical context to their storytelling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such is the size of the BBC Archive (millions of assets dating back to 1922), the process of finding illuminating content from it can be both time consuming and labour intensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        The BBC Archive Search portal exposes the archive you need through a single, easy to use website that produces results quickly and lets you take it where it needs to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        The number of content systems that have been indexed by the portal continue to increase. You will only see the systems for which you already have permission to view e.g. you must already have access to the Scottish Digital Library in order to see results from that system.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're also looking at adding more innovative ways to discover content. We invested in an english language speech-to-text technology to provide temporal information to assets that have audio and are investigating adding other languages and also the benefit of face recognition and object recognition technologies.

    <p>
        Enjoy.
